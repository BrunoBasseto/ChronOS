ChronOS is a small multi-threading executive for microprocessors and 
small sized architectures, like embedded systems, microcontrollers, 
DSPs and Systems-on-Chip (SOC).

Two modules are available by now, the Core and Network. Core module is 
the cooperative multithreading executive and environment, and the 
Network module, which depends on the Core, is a full implementation 
of a TCP-IP network stack.

With the current source code, the chronos.a or chronos.sa library file
can be generated by using the GCC open-source compiler, the MIPS port.

It was originally developed for the Intel 8086 and had being ported to 
several other architectures, such as the Motorola 68k, Philips XA, 
Microchip PIC24 and ARM variants. This port is for the MIPS-compatible 
Microchip PIC32 (M4K architecture).

Chronos is open-source, currently under the MIT license. See the LICENSE
file.

With Chronos it is possible to simplify the design of embedded 
applications, making its code cleaner and its maintenance simpler; and 
usually there is a considerable reduction in code size, allowing a more 
efficient usage of program memory.

With Chronos it is possible to optimize CPU resources management, by 
using threads, callbacks and independent timers, scheduling activities 
in an asynchronous way. It makes it easier to manage power, scaling 
CPU velocity accordingly to its load and/or enter idle or sleep modes 
safely.
